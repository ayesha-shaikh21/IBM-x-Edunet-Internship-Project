🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning


This project showcases the development of a machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using IBM Watsonx.ai and IBM Cloud Lite services. The goal of this system is to intelligently classify network traffic as either normal or anomaly, enabling early detection of potential cyber threats in real-time environments. ⚠📊

Using IBM AutoAI, a binary classification model was trained on a dataset consisting of 41 network features. The best-performing model was deployed using Watson Machine Learning as a REST API, making it accessible for real-time predictions. The model was tested and validated using both manually created inputs and the provided test dataset, showing reliable and accurate performance. 🚀

✨ This project was completed as part of my IBM x Edunet Foundation Virtual Internship on AI & Cloud.
